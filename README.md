# Networking-and-Security

Concepts to be familiar with.

OSI Model:
Open System Interconnection (OSI Model)
The OSI Model is a logical and conceptual model that defines network communication used by systems open to interconnection and communication with other systems. 
It also defines a logical network and effectively describes computer packet transfer by using various layers of protocols.

IP Addresses:
Logical address of a device in the network

MAC Addresses:
Hardware address of Network adapter
Every network adapter has a MAC (Media Access Control) address assigned to it when it is manufactured.

Routing and Switching:
The function of Routing is to Route packets between different networks (between different LANs - Local Area Networks).
Switch is to connect devices with the same network (LAN)

TCP/IP:
Transmission Control Protocol/ Internet Protocol
TCP/IP helps to determine how a specific computer should be connected to the internet and how you can transmit data between them. 
It helps you to create a virtual network when multiple computer networks are connected together.

It is specifically designed as a model to offer highly reliable and end-to-end byte stream over an unreliable internetwork.

TCP and UDP

DNS

VPN tunneling:
is an encrypted connection between your device and a VPN server. 

TLS and SSL:
SSL (Secure socket layer) protocal allows host to host Vpn type secure connection between two systems without the use vpn client software.
TLS (Transport layer security) is a cryptographic protocal used to create a secure encrypted connection between two end devices/applications.
