# Networking-and-Security

Concepts to be familiar with.

OSI Model:
Open System Interconnection (OSI Model)
The OSI Model is a logical and conceptual model that defines network communication used by systems open to interconnection and communication with other systems. 
It also defines a logical network and effectively describes computer packet transfer by using various layers of protocols.

IP Addresses:
Logical address of a device in the network

MAC Addresses:
Hardware address of Network adapter
Every network adapter has a MAC (Media Access Control) address assigned to it when it is manufactured.

Routing and Switching:
The function of Routing is to Route packets between different networks (between different LANs - Local Area Networks).
Switch is to connect devices with the same network (LAN)

Packet:
A packet, or network packet, is a formatted chunk of data sent over a network. 

TCP/IP:
Transmission Control Protocol/ Internet Protocol
TCP/IP helps to determine how a specific computer should be connected to the internet and how you can transmit data between them. 
It helps you to create a virtual network when multiple computer networks are connected together.

It is specifically designed as a model to offer highly reliable and end-to-end byte stream over an unreliable internetwork.

TCP and UDP:
TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is an important network protocol that lets two hosts connect and exchange data streams.  
TCP guarantees the delivery of data and packets in the same order as they were sent. 
UDP (User Datagram Protocol) is a long standing protocol used together with IP for sending data when transmission speed and efficiency matter more than security and reliability.



IPv4:
is the fourth version of the communication protocol underlying the Internet and the first version to be widely deployed.
IPv6:
is the current version of the communication protocol underlying the Internet. Slowly IPv6 is replacing IPv4, among other reasons because IPv6 allows for many different IP addresses.


DNS:(Domain Name System) Works exactly like a phonebook or Yellowpages
is a hierarchical and decentralized naming system for Internet connected resources. 
DNS maintains a list of domain names along with the resources, such as IP addresses, that are associated with them.
i.e. It's the process of computers use to resolve domain names to IP addresses

VPN tunneling:
is an encrypted connection between your device and a VPN server. 

TLS and SSL:
SSL (Secure socket layer) protocal allows host to host Vpn type secure connection between two systems without the use vpn client software.
TLS (Transport layer security) is a cryptographic protocal used to create a secure encrypted connection between two end devices/applications.

SSH:
Used to login and have a command Line session to a linux server

HTTP: HyperText Transfer Protocol
an application-layer protocol for transmitting hypermedia documents, such as HTML. 
It was designed for communication between web browsers and web servers, but it can also be used for other purposes

HTTPS: HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure 
is an encrypted version of the HTTP protocol. It uses SSL or TLS to encrypt all communication between a client and a server. 
This secure connection allows clients to safely exchange sensitive data with a server, such as when performing banking activities or online shopping.
